# SmartAd AB Testing
 This is my first foray into stastical analysis in R. I recently took some stastistics and statistical programming in R courses and found this data set on Kaggle to apply it to. The data is from an A/B test comparing the response rates of participants shown a dummy ad and participants shown an interactive SmartAd brand ad.
